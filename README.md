# Sans theme for oh-my-zsh

It is based on [frisk](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/frisk.zsh-theme) theme from the [default distribution](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Changes: color adjustment to look better with Solarized Light terminal theme, added support for Mercurial.

## Installation

Put the theme file to `custom/themes` inside your oh-my-zsh directory (by default it is in `$HOME/.oh-my-zsh`) and specify the theme name in your `.zshrc`.
